#Full Stack AI Image Generation
This is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) that generates AI images based on statements provided by the user. The application uses the openAI API for image generation and Cloudinary for image storage and retrieval.

#Technologies Used
React.js
tailwind CSS
openAI API
Cloudinary
MongoDB
Express.js
Node.js

#Functionality
The application allows users to input a statement, which is then sent to the openAI API to generate an AI image based on the text provided. The generated image is then displayed on the screen for the user to view. Additionally, the application allows users to upload their own images to Cloudinary for storage and retrieval.

#How to Use
To use the application, simply enter a statement in the input field and click the "Generate" button. The AI image will be generated and displayed on the screen. To upload your own image, click the "Upload" button and select the file you wish to upload. The uploaded image will be stored in Cloudinary and can be retrieved at any time by clicking the "Retrieve" button.

#Frontend
The frontend of the application was built using React.js and tailwind CSS. This allowed for easy development of reusable components and a responsive design.

#Backend
The backend of the application was built using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. This allowed for efficient storage and retrieval of user data and image files.

#Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in working with the MERN stack and integrating the frontend and backend of an application. Additionally, it provided the opportunity to work with the openAI API and Cloudinary for image generation and storage.
